%I dedicate this thesis to my loving wife Elyssa for always believing in me.
%I used to be nothing before I met my wife Elyssa. Now, I am everything. Everything I have, and everything I will have, is because of her love and support. She reminds me that anything is possible if I'm with her. I dedicate this thesis to her for these reasons. Thank you for everything.
%Before I met my wife, I had no purpose. Now, I know my purpose in life is to make her happy, because when she is happy, I am happy. I dedicate this thesis to her, because it couldn't have been done without her support. I love you, Elyssa.
I dedicate this thesis to my wife, Elyssa. Without her love and support, this would not have been possible. She is my guiding light. Thank you for everything.
