Battery State of Charge estimation is one of the key procedures in battery management systems. Typically, the measured voltage and current of a battery are used to estimate the state of charge. However, these measurements are prone to noise and the battery does not behave linearly. This means that the prediction method has to be able to handle the effect of nonlinear noise on the system. This thesis investigated noise removal and state estimation for a nonlinear model of a battery cell. The effect of the choice of filtering method and sampling rate was determined for various amounts of additive white Gaussian noise. The results can be applied to any battery system.
