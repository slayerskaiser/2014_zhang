\chapter{Results}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For a sampling period of $T_s=90,300$~s, refinement steps of $M=1,2,\dots,2^5$ were used. For the 100 Monte Carlo trials and the four filters, the number of divergences were counted, where a divergence is considered an absolute error in the estimated SOC greater than $0.1$~V or any failure in the filtering process, such as due to a non-invertible matrix or a non-positive definite covariance matrix. If a failure occurs, no attempt was made to keep filtering the system, and the remainder of
the SOC values are assumed to be zero. Additionally, the mean RMSE (MRMSE) is given, where the squared error for each filter is averaged over
time and the square root of the result is averaged over the trials.
